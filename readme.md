a simple music player that just works

the v1.x versions are built on a bad codebase, i am working on 2.0 every now and then but it will take a bit for it to be finished
the music player is very functual though

## Translations
I would apprechiate if you could help out with translations,
if you want to help you can find a .csv under the folder called "translation"
create a fork of the repo and modify the translations.csv file with a program like excel or libreoffice calc to include your language
then create a pull request including your translations
I will then merge the translations(annoy me if i forget)
